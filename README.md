# 🎬 Scene Editor

An interactive 3D scene editor — inspired by the official [Three.js Editor](https://threejs.org/editor/).  
Allows users to create, edit, and render complex 3D scenes directly in the browser or as a desktop application.

| `W`    | Translate                       |
| `E`    | Rotate                          |
| `R`    | Scale                           |
| `Del`  | Remove selected object from scene |
